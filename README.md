# ML-House-Price-Forecasting

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices in Austin, Texas. The project explores various predictive models and feature engineering techniques to improve accuracy in forecasting home prices based on factors such as property size, location, and additional home attributes.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build and compare several machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for predicting house prices. The models were trained on a dataset of Austin homes and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric.
